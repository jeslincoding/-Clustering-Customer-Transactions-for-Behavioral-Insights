# -Clustering-Customer-Transactions-for-Behavioral-Insights
This project aims to apply unsupervised learning techniques, particularly clustering, to analyze customer transaction data. By grouping customers with similar purchasing patterns, the project identifies key behavioral segments. These insights can help tailor marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction.

Unsupervised Learning Project: Clustering Customer Transactions

Overview

This project applies clustering techniques to identify patterns in customer transaction data. It uses K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering methods to group customers based on transaction history.

Features
